We are ADAholiks, a group of master students from various backgrounds! 

To introduce ourselves:

- **Fletcher**: Civil Engineering with a minor in Data Science  
- **Karl**: Materials Science  
- **Clay**: Digital Humanities  
- **Oscar**: Digital Humanities  
- **Finn**: SV with a minor in Data Science  

### Our motivation

We’re data junkies on a mission to make sense of chaos! Mixing engineering, humanities, and a dash of science, we’re here to crunch numbers, uncover stories, and have some fun while doing it.
