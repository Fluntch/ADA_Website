<h6>1. Different Categories</h6>
<p>Every horse belongs to a breed, a category. But are some breeds more common than others?</p>

<p>Geography and science dominate the herd, with art and mathematics fewer in number. The strongest steeds might be from the most common breeds, but it’s worth exploring which categories are found among the champions.</p>

<h6>2. Incoming and Outgoing Links</h6>
<p>A horse’s strength lies in its legs, or the number of links it has :</p>

<p>When we look at the incoming links, it's clear that geography dominates, with 8 out of the 10 most linked-to articles falling into this category. 
    Locations like "United States" and "United Kingdom" are frequently linked to a wide range of topics, acting as key landmarks on the trail that Cowboys can use to guide them. 
    The "United States" article, in particular, stands out not only for its high number of incoming links but also for having the most outgoing links, further solidifying its role as a central hub in the network. 
    Articles that are simply lists, like "List of countries," also tend to have many outgoing links, acting as directories that connect to a wide variety of other articles. 
    Overall, Geography, with its far-reaching connections, seems to be the backbone of the map guiding players across this vast terrain of information.</p>

<h6>3. Hyperlink Density</h6>

<p>Some horses are nimble, with a high density of links :</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/20872604" style="width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
    <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
    <noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20872604/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript>
</div>

<p>Articles with shorter lengths but many links often stand out in terms of hyperlink density, providing numerous connections without overwhelming the reader. 
    These concise, link-rich articles serve as efficient waypoints, guiding players quickly across the network without slowing their progress. 
    It looks like list-based articles exemplify this, acting as quick pivots for wandering cowboys, but offering less substance for the journey itself.</p>


<h6>4. Semantic Distances</h6>

<p>When we look at the relationships among horses, interesting patterns emerge :</p>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/UnitedStates_TSNE.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px; width: 65%; max-width: 10000px;">


<p>Tools like T-SNE reveal fascinating clusters, showing how articles are semantically connected. For example, "United States" occupies a central position within its network, highlighting its role as a hub. These distances allow us to visually map the relationships and closeness between topics.</p>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/embeddings_subject.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px; width: 65%; max-width: 10000px;">

<p>This plot gives us a clear picture of how our embeddings work as a way to measure the closeness and categories of articles. 
    We can see how articles naturally group together. For example, the green dots represent articles in the "People" category, while the orange ones belong to "History." Similar clusters appear for all major categories, showing just how connected these topics are.
It’s like mapping out the trails a cowboy might follow, the connections mirror the way players naturally think about how topics link together. Just like in the Wikispeedia game, where you don’t see the full map, you’ve got to rely on your own instincts and associations to find your way.</p>

<p>Our exploration highlights the unique attributes of these articles, from their category names to their navigational strength, helping us understand how they shape the cowboys' trails.</p>
