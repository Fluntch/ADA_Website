<h4> Defining article attributes </h4>

<h5>1. Different Categories</h25
<p>Every horse belongs to a breed, a category. But are some breeds more common than others?</p>

<p>Geography and science dominate the herd, with art and mathematics fewer in number. The strongest steeds might be from the most common breeds, but it’s worth exploring which categories are found among the champions.</p>

<h5>2. Incoming and Outgoing Links</h5>
<p>A horse’s strength lies in its legs, or the number of links it has:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Incoming Links:</strong> Some horses, like "United States," are sturdy and central to the herd, with many riders relying on them as destinations.</li>
    <li><strong>Outgoing Links:</strong> Others, like "List_of_countries," have legs that let them run far, acting as hubs for navigation.</li>
</ul>

<h5>3. Hyperlink Density</h5>
<p>Some horses are nimble, with a high density of links. List-based articles exemplify this, serving as quick pivots but offering less substance for the journey itself.</p>

<h5>4. Semantic Distances</h5>
<p>When we look at the relationships among horses, interesting patterns emerge. Using tools like T-SNE, we can see clusters—for instance, tropical storms form a tight-knit group, while "United States" sits at the center of its own network. These distances help us map the semantic closeness between articles.</p>

<p>Our exploration highlights the diverse abilities of these horses, from their category names to their navigational strength, helping us understand how they shape the cowboys' trails.</p>
