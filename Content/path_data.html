<p>Let’s take a look at the data first, partner. We’ve rounded up the path lengths of both finished and unfinished cowboy trails, all shown in the interactive graph below. You can toggle between different path types to compare the journey lengths and see just how far our cowboys rode to reach their targets. This gives us a solid sense of the average distance traveled and helps us spot any patterns in their route choices.</p>

<p>But remember, not all trails are created equal! Even the sharpest cowboys leave a few wild and woolly tracks behind. To make sure we’re only tracking the truly great trails, we’ve cleaned up the data with a few cowboy-approved rules of thumb.</p>


<section id="trail-analysis">
    <h4>Finished Trails</h4>
    <p>When a cowboy reaches their target, it’s a trail well-blazed! But even among these, we sift out only the best trails:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One Trail Per Cowboy-Target Pair:</strong> Cowboys are smart—they sometimes retrace their steps to learn the best route. However, we only keep the first unique trail for each cowboy and trail pair to ensure we aren’t biased by repeated attempts..</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Share of Trails:</strong> Limit each start-target pair to 5 trails to prevent overrepresentation.</li>
        <li><strong>No Trails to Nowhere:</strong> Remove trails with distance = 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Outliers Beware:</strong> Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, we rope in the good trails and leave out the statistical outlaws. For every group of trails with the same minimum distance (number of clicks to target), we remove those with extreme lengths or durations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Unfinished Trails</h4>
    <p>Not every cowboy reaches their target, but even these trails tell a story:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>True Failures Only:</strong> Analyse only trails where the cowboy actively stopped (failure reasons like "timeout" are removed). This ensures we’re only analyzing serious attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Outlier Lengths:</strong> Exclude unusually long trails using the IQR method.</li>
        <li><strong>Trail Sanity Check:</strong> If the simplified trail (removing loops) is shorter than the minimum possible distance, we mark it as implausible and exclude it. (.</li>
    </ol>
