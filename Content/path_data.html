<p>Let's start by looking at how many of our cowboys made it to their target:</p>

<p>Well, partner, looks like about 70% of our cowboys made it. That’s a whole lot of sharp-shootin’ and straight-ridin’! The other 30%? Maybe they got distracted by a cactus, chased a tumbleweed, or just decided the saloon back home was calling their name.</p>

<p>Let me tell you about simplified trails, partner. A simplified path is one where we’ve cleaned things up by removing any unnecessary loops and backtracking. We’re only left with the most direct route that the cowboy took to reach their target, cutting out the fluff and leaving behind just the essentials.</p>

<p>Below is the distribution of path lengths for the finished cowboy trails. You can toggle between different path types to compare the journey lengths.</p>

<p>Interesting insights ahead, partner! Looks like some trails wander far and wide, much longer than the rest. Maybe those cowboys were out sightseein’, or perhaps they just took the scenic route to soak up the prairie sun.</p>

<p>When we dig deeper, it seems a couple of cowboys found themselves locked in a duel over the same trail. Time and again, they retraced their steps between the same starting and target articles, each striving to outdo the other. </p>

<p>-------------------> HERE ADD PLOT OF THE ANECDOTE (FINN)</p>

<p>In the end, these Cowboys demonstrated how revisiting the same path might seem like a clever strategy, but it skews the game’s true spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s take a closer look at how we ensure only the best trails are considered in our analysis :</strong></p>

<section id="trail-analysis">
    <b>Finished Trails</b>
    <p>We refine the completed paths by applying the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>One Trail Per Cowboy-Target Pair:</strong> As we saw, cowboys are smart—they sometimes retrace their steps to learn the best route. However, we only keep the first unique trail for each cowboy and trail pair to ensure we aren’t biased by repeated attempts..</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Share of Trails:</strong> Each start-target pair is limited to 5 trails to prevent overrepresentation.</li>
        <li><strong>No Trails to Nowhere:</strong> Trails with a distance of 0 are excluded.</li>
        <li><strong>Outliers Beware:</strong> Using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, we rope in the good trails and leave out the statistical outlaws. we filter out trails with extreme lengths or durations.</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Unfinished Trails</b>
    <p>Even incomplete paths provide valuable insights:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>True Failures Only:</strong> Analyse only trails where the cowboy actively stopped (failure reasons like "timeout" are removed). This ensures we’re only analyzing serious attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Outlier Lengths:</strong> Exclude unusually long trails using the IQR method.</li>
        <li><strong>Trail Sanity Check:</strong> If the simplified trail is shorter than the minimum possible distance, we mark it as implausible and exclude it.</li>
    </ol>
