<h3><b>Graph theory based ranking</b></h3>

<p>When analysing the network of articles, graph theory offers a powerful tool for identifying those that play a central role in navigation. 
    Using a graph theory-based metric, we evaluate an article’s importance by examining how often it appears in the shortest paths connecting all possible source and target pairs. 
    To ensure fairness, we normalize these counts by the total number of shortest paths for each pair, preventing any bias toward articles that dominate only specific routes.</p>

<p>Interesting! This shows that topics tied to powerful countries (like the United States and the United Kingdom), vast regions (such as Europe and Africa), and major historical events (like World War II) are riding high in the rankings. 
This points to how geopolitical, regional, and historical themes are the backbone of the network, acting as key links between all kinds of different topics.</p> 

<p>However, graph theory alone doesn’t capture the full picture. To understand what players perceive as valuable articles, we turn to the actual played path data. 
The metrics we’ve introduced focus on what players themselves believe to be “good” articles—derived directly from their navigational choices and the strategies they employ.</p> 


<h3><b>Prioritizing Scores Based on Minimal Clicks</b></h3>

<p><b>1. Path Score</b>: Measures how closely the cowboy's path matches the shortest route. A score of 1 means the most efficient route.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Path Score</b> = Optimal Distance / Simplified Path Length</p>

<p><b>2. Article Scoring Based on Path Weights</b></h4>
<p>There are two ways to calculate article scores based on path weights:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Weighted Average</b>: Average path weights for each article.</li>
    <li><b>Sum of Centered Weights</b>: Compute the mean article weight and sum the centered weights for each article.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Scores Based on Detours</b></h3>
<p><b>3. Detour Ratio</b>: Compares the number of detours an article causes to its total appearances. Lower ratios are better.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Detour Ratio</b> = Detour Count / Total Appearances</p>

<h3><b>Scores Based on Unfinished Paths</b></h3>
<p><b>4. Unfinished Ratio</b>: Measures how often an article appears in incomplete paths. Higher ratios suggest failure.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Unfinished Ratio</b> = Unfinished Count / Total Appearances</p>

<h3><b>Scores for Faster Completion</b></h3>

<p><b>5. Weighted Average of Article Speed</b>: Calculates the average speed for articles based on the time per path length. Faster paths score higher.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Article Speed</b> = Sum of Path Speeds / Number of Paths</p>

<p><b>6. Sum of Centered Article Speed</b>: Measures how articles contribute to faster paths, centered by mean path speed.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Centered Speed</b> = Path Speed - Mean Path Speed</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Scaling is applied so that higher values always indicate better performance, even if lower ratios are preferred in certain metrics.</p>
