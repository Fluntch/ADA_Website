<h2><b>Article Scoring: Ranking the Steeds</b></h2>
    
<p>Now, partner, it’s time to score these trusty steeds and determine which ones truly guide our cowboys through the rugged trails. Here’s how we measure the “goodness” of articles, based on different types of scoring metrics:</p>
  
<h3><b>Prioritizing Scores Based on Minimal Clicks</b></h3>
  
<h4><b>1. Difference Between Played Path Length and Optimal Distance</b></h4>
<p><b>Path Score</b>: This score measures how closely the cowboy's path matches the shortest route to victory. The formula compares the Optimal Distance to the Simplified Path Length, where a score of 1 means the cowboy took the most efficient route.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Path Score</b> = Optimal Distance / Simplified Path Length</p>
  
<h4><b>2. Article Scoring Based on Path Weights</b></h4>
<p>Next, we use the path weights from each completed path to calculate article scores. There are two ways to do this:</p>
  
<ul>
    <li><b>Weighted Average</b>: Calculate the average of path weights for each article across all paths it appears in.</li>
    <li><b>Sum of Centered Weights</b>: First, compute the mean article weight and then sum all the centered weights for the paths the article appears in. This gives a better balance of quality and usefulness.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3><b>Scores Based on Article Appearance in Detours</b></h3>
  
<h4><b>3. Detour Ratio</b></h4>
<p>Articles that lead the cowboy astray on detours are ranked using the <b>Detour Ratio</b>, which compares the number of detour appearances to total appearances. Lower ratios indicate a more efficient article.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Detour Ratio</b> = Detour Count / Total Appearances</p>
  
<h3><b>Scores Based on Article Presence in Unfinished Paths</b></h3>
  
<h4><b>4. Unfinished Ratio</b></h4>
<p>The <b>Unfinished Ratio</b> measures how often an article appears in paths that were abandoned before reaching the target. A higher ratio suggests the article is associated with paths that end in failure.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Unfinished Ratio</b> = Unfinished Count / Total Appearances</p>
  
<h3><b>Scores Rewarding Faster Completion</b></h3>
  
<h4><b>5. Weighted Average of Article Speed</b></h4>
<p>Some paths are completed faster than others, and this score computes the average speed for articles based on the time taken divided by the path length. Articles appearing in faster paths score higher.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Article Speed</b> = Sum of Path Speeds / Number of Paths</p>
  
<h4><b>6. Sum of Centered Article Speed</b></h4>
<p>Much like the sum of centered weights, this score measures how articles contribute to faster paths. It centers the article speed by subtracting the mean path speed, then sums the results for articles across all paths.</p>
<p><i>Formula:</i> <b>Centered Speed</b> = Path Speed - Mean Path Speed</p>
  
<p><b>Important note about scaling:</b> We apply scaling to scores such that higher values always indicate better performance. For example, even though lower ratios are better for Detour and Unfinished scores, when scaled, larger values are better to keep things consistent.</p>
