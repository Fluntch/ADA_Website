<p> Well fella, I know what's probably going through your mind: do the defined scores correlate in any way with the article attrbiutes?</p>
<p> A correlation analysis was conducted between the article scores and the attrbiutes</p>
<p> --------------> Fletcher ca you put the last plot in notebook 3?</p>
<p> Interesting! It seems that the attrbiute that correlates with score the most is article length followed by the numbr of hyperlinks!
    On the other hand hyperlink density and the number of incoming links does not seem to be correlated in a significant manner to article score
